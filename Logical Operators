Logical Operators
As with comparison operators, you can also test for true (1) or false (0) values with logical operators.

Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 &&
