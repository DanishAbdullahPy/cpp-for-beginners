Declare Many Variables
To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:

Example
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;
One Value to Multiple Variables
You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

Example
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;
