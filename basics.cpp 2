C++ Output (Print Text)
The cout object, together with the << operator, is used to output values/print text:

Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
You can add as many cout objects as you want. However, note that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}
New Lines
To insert a new line, you can use the \n character:

Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World! \n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}


Tip: Two \n characters after each other will create a blank line:

Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World! \n\n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}


Example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}





Both \n and endl are used to break lines. However, \n is most used.

But what is \n exactly?
The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence, and it forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen. This results in a new line.

Examples of other valid escape sequences are:

Escape Sequence	Description
\t	Creates a horizontal tab	
\\	Inserts a backslash character (\)	
\"	Inserts a double quote character
